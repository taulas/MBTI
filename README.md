# MBTI dating app

Motivation behind this app:

My motivation on this app is based on, that last spring one oh mine closest friend was constantly
talking about MBTI personality types and he was able to pull mine interest for it. He has 
constantly teaching me how to analyze people putting them into different personalities, how 
different personalities work, and the compatibility with other personality types. One day while
having a discussion on MBTI we created an idea that there should be a dating app that would match 
people using their personality compatibilities. And the fourth semester gave me an opportunity for 
accomplishing it as I need to develop my personal app.

Description about the app:

The Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a test that assigns for person his own personality type,
which gives helpful information about how he functions, makes decisions, and compatibility with other
personalities.  MBTI dating app helps a person to find their compatible partner based on MBTI personality
compatibility. A good point of this app is that, is that is not required to know MBTI, as this application
has its own MBTI test which after completion assigns personality with detailed descriptions and suggested
personalities to date.
